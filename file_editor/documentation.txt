This is my documentation file that explain the 
characteristics of my program, as well as a manual for how to use this fileutil.c.
I have used Visual Studio Code for main coding, but have made sure they work on Linux environment.

This program that I have designed, is a utility software that performs viewing file, 
copying file, with modified extentions.

In order to compile the program, please go to your directory containing the file, using cd(Change Directory).
Once you are there, type In:
    gcc 32134541_fileutil.c -o utility
- What this does, is that it compiles using gcc. The argument -o specifies that I want to set the name of the compiled
program to be "utility". I prefer this since it is simple and easier to type.

Whenever you want to run execute the program, type in:
    ./utility
This will print out the first 10 lines in sample.txt, stored in the same directory.

If you want to specify a file to open and view, for example this text file:
    ./utility /Users/yoo/2100/Assignment1/documentation.txt 
This will open documentation.txt file and print the first 10 lines. Gives error message if incorrect file path.
Please note:
-You must type in absolute path to the file. I could have accepted relative path, but it is specified so and this
is my implementation, it has to be followed.
-When you add optional arguments such as -n, -d, -L, this filepath has to be the FIRST ARGUMENT no matter what, as this
is what this program assumes.

If you want to change the number of lines to, say, 3:
    ./utility -n 3
This will print the first 3 lines in sample.txt. Gives error if valid integer is not typed or it is missing after -n.

If you want to make a new file and copy certain lines into there:
    ./utility -d /Users/yoo/2100/Assignment1/directory1
This will create a file called sample.txt in directory1, and writes in the first 10 lines in sample.txt.
This will copy specified lines to a destination directory.

If you want to go into Tail Mode:
    ./utility -L
This will print out the last 10 lines in sample.txt to terminal.

Now that all options are introduced, any combination of them works in any order.
For instance, 

    ./utility /Users/yoo/2100/Assignment1/documentation.txt -L -n 4
This will print out the last 4 lines in documentation.txt file

    ./utility /Users/yoo/2100/Assignment1/documentation.txt -n 12 -d /Users/yoo/2100/Assignment1/directory1
This will create a new file called documentation.txt in directory1, and the first 12 lines are copied from original to the
destination.

    ./utility -n 3 -L
This will writes out the the console, the last 3 elements in sample.txt from the current directory

    ./utility -n three 
This will give an error since invalid argument type.

    ./utility -d Assignment1/directory1
This will result in an error message due to incomplete absolute path to the directory.


Here is a summary of optional arguments after ./utility (Copied from specimen sheet)
sourcefile: 
    Allows the user to input a path for the sourcefile to display/copy.
    sourcefile must appear immediately after the command (e.g., ./fileutil sourcefile).
-d destdir 
    Allows the user to input a path for the destination directory for copying the source file.
    (destdir must appear immediately after -d)
-n numlines 
    Allows the user to input a number to specify how many lines of text should be displayed/copied.
    (numlines must appear immediately after -n)
-L 
    Makes the program to switch to Tail mode where the View/Copy should be performed on the
    last 10 (or n) lines.
